Overview
Please provide the following:

If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
A brief description of your project.
SharePoint is used by most top 50 Major Banks in U.S. SharePoint is used by 90% of Fortune 500 companies. SharePoint is used by 80% Federal Government Agencies. 190 million people use SharePoint. There is a great need for microtransactions within Government Agencies to track and allocate resources. Most Corporations use SharePoint for their Intranet and custom development. Banks use SharePoint for almost all their regulatory monetary workflows. SharePoint is already a very big part of these Entities infrastructure . By integrating Dot into a SharePoint Template. Corp to Corp transactions. Dot Template on the SharePoint MarketPlace. A foot in Door...
Target users are all companies that use SharePoint. Corporations can send payments to other corporations that have SharePoint, which is most forture 500 companies. Banks can use microtransactions within their workflows. Banks currently use Power Apps to create monetary workflows, but when it comes to actually moving value, then it is not available to the workflow. Government Agencies can use custom tokens to allocate and lend assets to other government agencies. SharePoint has 190 million users. All the Companies that have SharePoint also use it for custom development.

Creating a SharePoint Template and webparts that will allow any Entity that uses SharePoint to upload this SharePoint Package. This will create Document Libraries and Lists and webpart libraries to support the Dot API and enable the Entity to use Dot and Create custom tokens to be used within the intranet . Most of these Entities that use SharePoint use it as a development platform for creating custom workflows and programs. Thus the high demand for SharePoint Developers. By making Dot ledger available for these corporations, there is a high demand for micro transactions between various sub divisions of Government agencies. Banks use SharePoint for almost all their monetary transactions within the bank using Power Apps to create easy to manage Workflows. The ability to implement Dot for microtransactions within these workflows would greatly improve efficiency and functionality. There are countless applications that can be built around Dot if it is available within SharePoint to be used by developers and Power Users creating workflows. SharePoint represents about 30% of Microsoft's profits year over year. SharePoint is effectively the backbone of most Corporations and Government Agencies . By giving these entities easy access to integrate Dot and custom tokens into their development teams and power users. It opens up endless possibilities to Dot. Most of these agencies use SharePoint for their intranets . Dot can be integrated into the culture and workflows of these entities if they have easy access to the Dot Ledger through the SharePoint MarketPlace. This would make it available to any Agency or Corporation that has SharePoint . Banks use SharePoint for creating Power Apps Workflows to meet their Regulatory and Monetary Policy needs. These Workflows can accomplish everything except move value within the workflow.(This is still a manual process) . With Dot and custom tokens , the workflows will be able to move monetary value from within the workflow. This will enable these monetary workflows to be detached from any manual steps that are related to moving monetary value within the workflow.

I have worked with several Teams from India. I would need to hire a team of about 8 Developers and a tester to complete these tasks within a year. Example: I was senior architect for a large project with Hartford Insurance. It took a team for 8 developers to complete a similar sized project. In order to make the project truly viable with 8 Developers would be needed .However, if successful. Dot and Dot would be automatically implemented on the backend of all Major Banks and fortune 500 companies as well as 80% of Federal Government Agencies. These Entities use SharePoint as their BackBone platform for most of their internal Development needs. Because SharePoint is already being used at these Companies and Banks, Dot would have a "foot in the door" of these companies. It is easy to implement a SharePoint Template within these Companies. All these Entities have Expert in house Developers that support sharepoint and create new functionality as needed for the Company. It is much easier to release a new concept like Dot into a company that already uses SharePoint than proposing a completely new installment of a foreign third party system. Not to mention the regulatory and approval hurtles that come with deployment of a third party software tool. So I am proposing that integrating Dot into a system that already exists within the company is much easier than convincing a company to install a third party software. 4) I plan on using JIRA for bug tracking and development. Technologies used: SharePoint Online 2023, SharePoint 2016 On-Prem, Visual Studio Code, React, TypeScript, JavaScript. PowerShell

Dot would available and be integrated into Banks, Corporations and most Federal Agencies. Dot functionality would be available to SharePoint developers by simply uploading the SharePoint Template with Dot integrated into the webparts and extensions on the Template. SharePoint has over 190 million users and a very active developer community. By having a Template with all the Dot functionality built into it, Developers would be more comfortable integrating this new paradigm into their systems. Simple by downloading the Template. Also it bypasses any uncomfortableness about using any third party software that would otherwise need to be installed in order to get Dot into their business processes.

SharePoint development is needed for most entities that use SharePoint. Uploading the SharePoint Template to SharePoint MarketPlace will allow developers to integrate Dot into their programs and workflows. Presentations on SharePoint Saturdays . SharePoint Saturdays happen in every major city in the U.S. It is a great venue for SharePoint Developers to get together and present ideas and set up booths.

PowerShell This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We recommend that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ‚âà 1 month.

‚ùó If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.

SharePoint development is needed for most entities that use SharePoint. Uploading the SharePoint Template to SharePoint MarketPlace will allow developers to integrate Dot into their programs and workflows. Presentations on SharePoint Saturdays . SharePoint Saturdays happen in every major city in the U.S. It is a great venue for SharePoint Developers to get together and present ideas and set up booths.
