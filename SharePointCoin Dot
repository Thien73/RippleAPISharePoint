SharePoint is used by most top 50 Major Banks in U.S. SharePoint is used
by 90% of Fortune 500 companies. SharePoint is used by 80% Federal
Government Agencies. 190 million people use SharePoint. There is a great
need for microtransactions within Government Agencies to track and
allocate resources. Most Corporations use SharePoint for their Intranet
and custom development. Banks use SharePoint for almost all their
regulatory monetary workflows. SharePoint is already a very big part of
these Entities infrastructure . By integrating  A Custom Coin into a
SharePoint Template. Corp to Corp transactions. A Custom Coin Template on
the SharePoint MarketPlace. A foot in Door\...

Target users are all companies that use SharePoint. Corporations can
send payments to other corporations that have SharePoint, which is most
forture 500 companies. Banks can use microtransactions within their
workflows. Banks currently use Power Apps to create monetary workflows,
but when it comes to actually moving value, then it is not available to
the workflow. Government Agencies can use  A Custom tokens to allocate and
lend assets to other government agencies. SharePoint has 190 million
users. All the Companies that have SharePoint also use it for custom
development.

1\) Creating a SharePoint Template and webparts that will allow any
Entity that uses SharePoint to upload this SharePoint Package. This will
create Document Libraries and Lists and webpart libraries to support the
 A Custom Coin API and enable the Entity to use  A Custom Coin and Create custom
tokens to be used within the intranet . Most of these Entities that use
SharePoint use it as a development platform for creating custom
workflows and programs. Thus the high demand for SharePoint Developers.
By making  A Custom Coin ledger available for these corporations, there is a
high demand for micro transactions between various sub divisions of
Government agencies. Banks use SharePoint for almost all their monetary
transactions within the bank using Power Apps to create easy to manage
Workflows. The ability to implement  A Custom Coin for microtransactions
within these workflows would greatly improve efficiency and
functionality. There are countless applications that can be built around
 A Custom Coin if it is available within SharePoint to be used by developers
and Power Users creating workflows. SharePoint represents about 30% of
Microsoft\'s profits year over year. SharePoint is effectively the
backbone of most Corporations and Government Agencies . By giving these
entities easy access to integrate  A Custom Coin and custom tokens into
their development teams and power users. It opens up endless
possibilities to  A Custom Coin. Most of these agencies use SharePoint for
their intranets .  A Custom Coin can be integrated into the culture and
workflows of these entities if they have easy access to the  A Custom Coin
Ledger through the SharePoint MarketPlace. This would make it available
to any Agency or Corporation that has SharePoint . Banks use SharePoint
for creating Power Apps Workflows to meet their Regulatory and Monetary
Policy needs. These Workflows can accomplish everything except move
value within the workflow.(This is still a manual process) . With  A Custom
Coin and custom tokens , the workflows will be able to move monetary
value from within the workflow. This will enable these monetary
workflows to be detached from any manual steps that are related to
moving monetary value within the workflow. 2) A. Proof of concept is
done B. Create web part libraries and Extensions all using  A Custom Coin C.
Create Scripts to create SharePoint Templates D) Create PowerShell
library scripts for Document libraries E) Migration Scripts for
SharePoint online from On-Prem F) Integrate SharePoint Search into
Template G) Create Power Apps workflow entities H) integrate Ledger into
SharePoint Lists G) integrate SharePoint Search into Ledger for
DataLayer 3) I was a SharePoint Senior Developer/ Architect with
Cognizant Technologies. I have worked with several Teams from India. I
would need to hire a team of about 8 Developers and a tester to complete
these tasks within a year. Example: I was senior architect for a large
project with Hartford Insurance. It took a team for 8 developers to
complete a similar sized project. In order to make the project truly
viable with 8 Developers would be needed .However, if successful.  A Custom
Coin and  A Custom Coin would be automatically implemented on the backend of
all Major Banks and fortune 500 companies as well as 80% of Federal
Government Agencies. These Entities use SharePoint as their BackBone
platform for most of their internal Development needs. Because
SharePoint is already being used at these Companies and Banks,  A Custom
Coin would have a \"foot in the door\" of these companies. It is easy to
implement a SharePoint Template within these Companies. All these
Entities have Expert in house Developers that support sharepoint and
create new functionality as needed for the Company. It is much easier to
release a new concept like  A Custom Coin into a company that already uses
SharePoint than proposing a completely new installment of a foreign
third party system. Not to mention the regulatory and approval hurtles
that come with deployment of a third party software tool. So I am
proposing that integrating  A Custom Coin into a system that already exists
within the company is much easier than convincing a company to install a
third party software. 4) I plan on using JIRA for bug tracking and
development. Technologies used: SharePoint Online 2023, SharePoint 2016
On-Prem, Visual Studio Code, React, TypeScript, JavaScript. PowerShell

 A Custom Coin would available and be integrated into Banks, Corporations
and most Federal Agencies.  A Custom Coin functionality would be available
to SharePoint developers by simply uploading the SharePoint Template
with  A Custom Coin integrated into the webparts and extensions on the
Template. SharePoint has over 190 million users and a very active
developer community. By having a Template with all the  A Custom Coin
functionality built into it, Developers would be more comfortable
integrating this new paradigm into their systems. Simple by downloading
the Template. Also it bypasses any uncomfortableness about using any
third party software that would otherwise need to be installed in order
to get  A Custom Coin into their business processes.

SharePoint development is needed for most entities that use SharePoint.
Uploading the SharePoint Template to SharePoint MarketPlace will allow
developers to integrate  A Custom Coin into their programs and workflows.
Presentations on SharePoint Saturdays . SharePoint Saturdays happen in
every major city in the U.S. It is a great venue for SharePoint
Developers to get together and present ideas and set up booths.

There is no  A Custom Coin or cryptocurrency being used within SharePoint.
By putting  A Custom Coin on a SharePoint Template, it makes it available to
developers and power users to create workflows that can move value. It
also allows developers to use custom tokens and  A Custom Coin to move value
using custom developed programs and workflows.

SharePoint has a user base of 190 million users. There is a Global
SharePoint MarketPlace and very active community of Developers.
Uploading the Template for Use on the Global MarketPlace will enable
Developers to install and develop with the webparts and Template
functions and extensions. SharePoint Saturdays happen all over the U.S.
these are great venues to have presentations and booths to spread the
ideas. SharePoint Developers are a very active and passionate group.
